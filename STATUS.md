# Tertius — status

Last updated: 2026-08-02

## Where it stands

Working, and in real use. Built from `transcription-app-claude-code-prompt.md`,
plus everything requested since: the launcher, folder picker, model download
progress, model comparison + machine check, tooltips, light/dark theme, mirrored
output folders, and timestamping of supplied text.

**187 tests, all passing.** Whisper is mocked throughout — the suite downloads
nothing and decodes no audio.

Run it: double-click `Start Tertius.bat`.

Repo: `github.com/sethkopak/tertius` (private), branch `main`.

## What it does now

- **Transcribe** a queue of audio/video files, resumably, on the GPU.
- **Timestamp text you already have** instead of writing a fresh transcript.
  A `.txt` is paired with each audio file by name; your wording is kept exactly
  and only timings are added, at Auto / Per Paragraph / Per Sentence granularity.
  Text that is never spoken (title pages, page numbers, footnotes) is kept
  verbatim without a timestamp. Confirmed working on real material 2026-08-02.
- **Output mirrors the source folders**, so same-named files in different folders
  no longer overwrite each other.
- Tells you what it is doing: model download progress, which device it is really
  using, where it looked for text files, and why a GPU is unusable.

## Verified by actually running it

Not just by tests:

- **Resume across a hard kill.** Killed the server with `Stop-Process -Force`
  while a file was mid-transcription, restarted: the interrupted file was reset
  to pending and re-transcribed, the finished one skipped, the untouched one ran.
- **Real transcription with the real model.** `tiny` on CPU against a generated
  WAV: downloaded, decoded, transcribed, wrote output, completed.
- **Folder picker.** Dialog opens (window class `#32770`, correct title), cancel
  returns `cancelled: true`, and the server keeps answering requests while it is
  open.
- **Download progress against the real Hugging Face stack.** 0% → 10.5% → 24.1%
  → 99.9% for an uncached model.
- **Double-launch.** Second run of the launcher reuses the running server rather
  than starting a second one.
- **UI in the browser.** Scan → queue → start → live polling → completed with
  per-file download links. Model table, theme toggle, and download panel all
  checked visually. No console errors.

## 2026-08-02 — GPU incident, fixed

First real use (17 files, ~38 min each) hit
`RuntimeError: Library cublas64_12.dll is not found or cannot be loaded`, then
**hung**. Root cause: the NVIDIA driver is installed but the CUDA runtime
libraries are not, so `get_cuda_device_count()` reported 1 device and `auto`
chose the GPU. Confirmed on this machine — no `cublas64_12.dll` anywhere.

Three separate defects, all fixed and verified against the real failure:

1. **`auto` trusted a device count instead of proving the GPU works.** Loading a
   model on CUDA succeeds even with no runtime libraries; only the first encode
   fails. Now a one-second dummy transcription runs at job start. `auto` falls
   back to the CPU and says why; explicit `cuda` fails with the fix instructions.
2. **A failed CUDA call poisons the process.** Reproduced directly: after one
   CUDA failure, the *next* CUDA attempt deadlocked for 10 minutes rather than
   raising. That is what wedged file 2 in the original incident. The first
   failure is now remembered process-wide and the GPU is never retried.
3. **Cancel lied.** It is checked between files, so a wedged native call meant
   "CANCELLING" forever with no explanation. It now reports how long it has been
   waiting and, after 20s, offers **Force stop** (kills the server; safe because
   state is durable and Resume redoes the interrupted file).

Also: three consecutive identical failures now stop the batch instead of failing
all 17 files one at a time.

Fixed by installing `nvidia-cublas-cu12` + `nvidia-cudnn-cu12` (~1.2 GB) into the
venv. One wrinkle worth remembering: `os.add_dll_directory()` was **not** enough
to make CTranslate2 find them — it only affects loads that opt into
`LOAD_LIBRARY_SEARCH_USER_DIRS`, and CTranslate2 uses a plain `LoadLibrary`.
Prepending those folders to `PATH` is what actually works.

Tertius now detects all of this at startup: a CUDA GPU with missing runtime
libraries produces a console warning and a UI banner with the fix, and the model
comparison table judges against the memory that will really be used.

## Proven on real work (2026-08-02)

The three biggest gaps are now closed, all in one run:

- **Real speech, real model, real GPU.** `V1_00.mp3` (22.6 min of narration)
  transcribed with `large-v3-turbo` on the RTX 2060 in **about 60 seconds** —
  roughly 22x faster than realtime. Output reads correctly, including proper
  nouns and punctuation; SRT timings line up.
- CUDA runtime libraries installed (`nvidia-cublas-cu12`, `nvidia-cudnn-cu12`,
  ~1.2 GB) and the GPU verified end-to-end through the server.
- `large-v3-turbo` downloads and runs; float16 on the 6 GB card is comfortable.

## 2026-08-02 — text timestamping, and two bugs it exposed

Supplied-text timestamping went in and Seth confirmed it works on real material.
Getting there turned up two defects worth recording:

1. **Uploads never ran the text matching.** `add_files()` was called without the
   flag, so an uploaded file was always mode `transcribe`, silently. Worse,
   `.txt` uploads were rejected and deleted, so supplying text that way was
   impossible. Both fixed; `.txt` now uploads and pairs by name.
2. **"No text found" gave no clue why.** The cause was that a browser never
   sends a file's original location, so `Upload & queue` copies audio into
   `_uploads/` and *that* becomes "beside the audio" — the user's text file next
   to the original was unreachable. Fixed with an optional **Text folder**
   (searched recursively) and by reporting the exact folders searched in the UI.

Both are the same underlying lesson: a feature that silently does the wrong thing
is worse than one that fails loudly.

## Not verified — read this before trusting it

- Only one transcript and one aligned output have been read closely. Accuracy
  across a whole volume, and on harder audio, is still unassessed.
- Windows only so far.
- Long-batch behaviour (17 files back to back) has not been run start to finish.
- Alignment has not been tried on a text that diverges heavily from the audio
  (abridged, reordered, or a different edition).

## Next steps

1. Run a full volume through and read a few outputs properly.
2. Decide what this is: personal tool, or something that ships.

## Ideas not built

- No **Clear queue** button in the UI — clearing means deleting the state file
  by hand.
- Whisper can also *translate* to English (`task="translate"`); Tertius only
  transcribes. The library supports it — it is just not exposed.
- Language is a free-text code box. A dropdown of the 100 supported languages
  with real names would be friendlier.
- Alignment reports how many chunks went untimed in the log, but the UI does not
  show it per file. Worth surfacing if a text ever aligns badly.
- No live microphone input; file/batch only, as the original spec required.

## Gotchas worth remembering

- **PowerShell corrupts UTF-8 text files. Do not use it to rewrite text here.**
  `Get-Content -Raw` decodes as cp1252 in PS 5.1, so read-modify-write
  double-encodes every em-dash, ellipsis and symbol, and `Set-Content -Encoding
  utf8` adds a BOM. It has now silently damaged files twice in this project —
  the templates during a rename, and a stray BOM dropped mid-README. Use Python
  or an editor for any text rewrite.
- **Windows allows a second bind to a port already in use.** Two servers on 5005
  will happily share (and corrupt) one state file. `--reuse-existing` guards the
  launcher path; do not start two by hand against one output directory.
- **cmd does not process `^` escapes inside quoted arguments.** A `^|` inside a
  `powershell -Command "..."` string reaches PowerShell literally and kills it
  with no visible error.
- **`huggingface_hub` progress bars lie about totals.** Overlapping bars roughly
  double the byte count, and a bar's `total` can be set after construction. Use
  the ratio for the percentage, not the byte figures.
- Each launch shows as two `python.exe` processes (venv redirector). Relevant
  when counting processes to check whether a second server started.
- `faster-whisper` / `ctranslate2` install fine on Python 3.14.
